STRINGBUILDER Exercises:
Prerequisites:
Refer: Read the class description & the methods in the StringBuilder class javadoc
1. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with no String & print the length of it. Then add a String
to it & print the length & the final String
2. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with a String & print the length of it. Then add 4 Strings
to it & each String separated by a “#” & print the length & the final String
3. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with two Strings with a space in between & print the
length of it. Then insert another String in between those two Strings & print the length & the final
String. Space should be there between Strings.
4. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with two Strings with a space in between & print the
length of it. Then delete the first String & print the length & the final String
5. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with 3 Strings with a space in between & print the
length of it. Then replace the space with “-”  & print the length & the final String
6. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with 3 Strings with a space in between & print the
length of it. Then reverse the string  & print the length & the final String
7. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with a String(minimum 10 chars) & print the length of it.
Then delete the characters from 6 to 8 index  & print the length & the final String
8. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with a String(minimum 10 chars) & print the length of it.
Then replace the characters from 6 to 8 index with “XYZ”  & print the length & the final String
9. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with 3 Strings with a “#” in between & print the length of
it. Then find the index of the first “#” in the StringBuilder
10. Write a program to create a StringBuilder with 3 Strings with a “#” in between & print the length of
